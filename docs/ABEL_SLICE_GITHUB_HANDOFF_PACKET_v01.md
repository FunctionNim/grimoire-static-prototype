# ABEL SLICE GITHUB HANDOFF PACKET v0.1

Status: LOCKED / HANDOFF-READY AFTER QA ACCEPTANCE

Repository: FunctionNim/grimoire-static-prototype

## Purpose

This packet translates the locked Abel vertical slice planning sheets into a GitHub-ready implementation handoff. It should be used after the first QA script is accepted, not as permission to expand scope.

The handoff goal is to build one playable slice, not the full game.

## Active source sheets

Use these spreadsheet tabs as the active source of truth:

1. WORKBOOK_SUPERSESSION_AND_ACTIVE_CANON_INDEX_v01
2. ABEL_SLICE_SYMBOL_PACKET_PRODUCTION_TIER_LIST_v02
3. ABEL_SLICE_PLAYER_LOOP_START_MENU_v01
4. ABEL_SLICE_MAP_PACKET_v01
5. ABEL_SLICE_SYSTEM_HOOKS_v01
6. ABEL_SLICE_BUILD_ORDER_v02
7. ABEL_SLICE_FIRST_QA_SCRIPT_v03
8. BEAST_STARTER_ACQUISITION_WILDERNESS_GATE_FLOW_v01
9. BEAST_ENCOUNTER_HEX_FIELD_LAW_v01
10. WILDERNESS_CLASH_COMPANION_TUNING_TERRAIN_LAW_v02
11. WILDERNESS_CLASH_DEFEATED_BEAST_AGENT_OPTIONS_v03
12. WILDERNESS_CLASH_PRESSURE_GEM_CORRECTION_PATCH_v04

Superseded sheets must not override these. Do not restore the old one-called-beast wilderness mode, Hollow/Sealed active terminology, or merchant Empty Gem starter rule.

## Slice scope

The first playable Abel slice contains:

- Start menu
- City of Abel center hub
- Three guild halls only
- One Brown Pyramid civilization node
- Plainlands around Abel
- Tall grass route
- Water pond route
- Tree line boundary
- Gathering spots
- One elite negative pressure patch
- Starter beast family choice
- Beast companion registration
- Merchant/trade path for two additional beasts
- Wilderness gate requiring three ready beasts
- Beast Encounter hex-field auto-battler
- Victory remnant choices
- Lockroom pressure encounter hook
- Unified rewards/storage/recovery loop

## Non-goals for this slice

Do not build these yet:

- All ten guilds
- Full city sprawl
- Full civilization economy
- Actual player-built guild construction
- Fourth typed/custom mission answer option
- Beast XP, beast levels, or evolution
- Full bestiary
- Multi-hex beasts
- Large/tiny beast classes
- Deep tactical manual battle commands
- Complex AI
- Full Lockroom campaign
- Final art polish before Tier 0 and Tier 1 symbol readability

## Critical active canon

### Beast acquisition

- The player chooses a starter family: Mountain, River, or Cloud.
- The exact starter beast is randomly selected from that family's starter-safe pool.
- The guild provides one starter Filled Pressure Gem / beast candidate.
- The player must obtain two more beasts through civilization missions, trades, or merchants before entering wilderness.
- Civilization merchants sell Filled Pressure Gems / beast candidates.
- Empty Pressure Gems mainly come from Orange creation and special sources.
- Beasts do not gain levels.

### Pressure gem terms

- Empty Pressure Gem = available vessel.
- Filled Pressure Gem = contains captured wilderness beast pressure / beast candidate.
- Released Gem = Filled Pressure Gem returned to empty state, usually from overflow/return handling.

### Defeated beast options

After a Beast Clash victory, defeated beast remnants are clickable.

- Universal option: Loot.
- Clay: recover companion health or ability count.
- Gray: capture defeated beast into Filled Pressure Gem.
- Orange: create Empty Pressure Gem.
- Gold Order: Memory Imprint / knowledge.

One remnant gives one outcome unless a future upgrade explicitly changes this.

### Beast Encounter field

- Central 37-hex board.
- Player beasts deploy from the left.
- Enemy beasts deploy from the right.
- Bottom tray shows up to five owned beast cards, with left/right arrows if more than five.
- Player may deploy up to three ready beasts.
- All beasts occupy one hex in this slice.
- Mountain enemies create Boulders.
- River enemies create Water Spots.
- Cloud enemies create Hollows.
- Obstacles cannot appear on deployment hexes.
- Generated maps must keep at least two traversable approach lanes.

### Gate rule

The wilderness gate opens only when the player has at least three registered ready beast companions.

Do not count:

- Unregistered Filled Pressure Gems
- Memory Imprints
- Exhausted beasts
- Captured-unavailable beasts
